comment = "An example influence diagram for Joe, who has to decide \
	whether to buy a certain used car which may be a 'peach' or a \
	'lemon'.  He has the option of doing some tests beforehand, \
	and of buying it with a guarantee or not.\n\
	This is the classic example of an influence diagram derived \
	from a decision problem with a very asymmetric decision tree, \
	since if Joe decides not to test then the test results have \
	no meaning, etc.\n\
	This problem was posed (in decision tree representation) by \
	Howard62, and is described as an influence diagram in Qi94 \
	and in SmithHM93.";
